# X3DH_DoubleRatchet
  Hello. I am not completely sure about this code, but it works. I created 
a program similar to Signal. I encountered a problem with X3DH, so I used 
3DH without OPK, and the signature key was a separate key on the side. I'm 
confident it's working well. Additionally, I implemented the Double Ratchet 
algorithm (KDF + DH). I used AES-GCM-256, and this discussion helped me implement AEAD.
